              <h3>Chasing of LED</h3>
              <p>
                I have successfully completed a PIC microcontroller
                based project titled 'LED Chasing'. This project involved
                utilizing the capabilities of PIC microcontroller to create an
                LED chasing circuit which simulates the chasing of lights. The
                project required a great deal of technical knowledge, skill and
                patience, but I am thrilled with the outcome. The LED chasing
                circuit demonstrates my understanding of microcontroller
                programming, circuit design and my ability to work independently
                 as well as part of a team.

            <h3>BOOST converter</h3>
            As a member of a highly motivated and dedicated team, I am proud to
            have played a key role in the successful completion of a challenging
             power electronics project - a Boost Converter circuit, where we
             designed and wound our own inductor. This project required a
             significant level of technical skill, knowledge and expertise, as
             well as the ability to collaborate effectively and persevere through
              obstacles. Despite facing numerous setbacks and failures during
              the development phase, we were able to overcome them by constantly
               referring to various resources such as books, journals, and online
                tutorials. The end result was a fully functional Boost Converter
                 circuit that exemplifies my understanding of circuit design,
                 power electronics, and my ability to work in a team environment,
                  as well as my persistence, patience, and resourcefulness.
                   It was an incredibly rewarding experience to see our hard work
                    come to fruition and witness the circuit working with our
                    custom-wound inductor.

              <h3>Bank Management System</h3>
              <p>
                I worked on an Object-Oriented Programming
                (OOPs) based project named 'Bank Management System'. It was a
                software project that was developed using C++, which is an OOPs
                 based programming language. The system was designed to automate
                  the various operations of a bank such as account creation,
                  account management, transactions, and reporting.
                  I was responsible for the design and implementation of the
                  account management module which included features like account
                   creation, account balance check, account closure, and account
                    details update. The experience of working on this project
                     helped me to understand the software development process
                     and the application of OOPs concepts in real-world scenarios.
                      The project was a great learning experience as it helped
                      me to understand the significance of OOPs.
